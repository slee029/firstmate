# Choose the first quota-eligible candidate from a ranked list.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-quota-choose.sh [--snapshot <path>] [--candidate <harness:model>]...
#
# Reads one already-captured quota-axi default TOON or JSON snapshot from the
# provided file, or from stdin when --snapshot is omitted.
# bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh owns schema compatibility and the shared row join.
# For each --candidate in order, it maps <harness> to its primary provider
# family, then applies the matched row's provider-wide scopes and exact model
# or product scopes for <model>. A candidate is eligible only when no
# applicable runway is `exhausted_now` and its known
# effective percent remaining is greater than zero. The first eligible
# candidate is printed as "<harness> <model>" and the script exits 0.
# If no candidate is quota-eligible, it prints "none" and exits 1.
#
# Candidates are accepted as `--candidate <harness:model>` or as positional
# colon-separated arguments, with earlier candidates preferred.
# This script is deterministic and safe: it performs no side effects and exits
# nonzero when the environment would lead to an unsafe dispatch.
#
# The helper is the canonical worker-side selection used after the agent has
# already run `quota-axi` for its model selection. It never replaces the agent's
# reasoning-class or runway-feasibility gates; it only answers which ordered
# candidate remains eligible under the captured quota evidence.
#
# Multi-provider limitation: this helper maps each harness to ONE primary
# provider family (fm_quota_provider_for_harness in bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh)
# and checks quota for that
# family only. Some harnesses can run models from several providers - for
# example, Pi and OpenCode may dispatch xAI, Anthropic, or other models - so a
# candidate whose established provider differs from the harness's primary family
# is checked against the wrong quota row. This is an accepted limitation of the
# optional helper. Authoritative multi-provider routing - including provider
# discovery from the harness catalog and quota matching by that explicit
# provider - is owned by AGENTS.md section 4 and the quota-array-dispatch skill,
# not by this helper. Use this helper only when the brief already fixed the
# candidate order and every candidate's provider is the harness's primary family.
#
# omp (Oh My Pi) has no single primary family, so its candidate model prefix
# selects the family: openai-codex/<id> checks the codex row and
# claude-bridge/<id> checks the claude row, each against the bare <id> for
# model: and product: scopes. Any other or absent prefix is refused up front,
# the same shape as an unknown harness, because no quota-axi row measures it.
# quota-axi reports Codex quota unavailable on this host because omp carries
# its own Codex login, so an openai-codex candidate reads as unknown quota here
# and is never selected on this host; its runway is disclosed uncertainty for
# the agent-side gates, not measured headroom.
